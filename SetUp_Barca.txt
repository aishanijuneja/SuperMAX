Date: May 13, 2016
Session: Free Practice 1

===============================================================================
Aerodynamic Setup:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Front Wing Angle: 3.5
- Rear Wing Angle: 5.0
- Aero Configuration: Medium to high downforce setup optimized for stability in high-speed corners (Turns 3, 9, and 12) and enhanced grip in medium-speed sections (Turns 5, 7, and 10).

===============================================================================
Suspension Setup:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Ride Height: 75mm front, 85mm rear
- Spring Stiffness: 800N/mm front, 1000N/mm rear
- Anti-roll Bars: Medium stiffness to maintain responsive handling characteristics while ensuring stability under braking and through corner exit.

===============================================================================
Brake Balance:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Front Brake Bias: 54%
- Rear Brake Bias: 46%
- Brake balance adjusted towards the front to optimize braking stability under heavy braking zones like Turn 1 and Turn 10, while maintaining rear stability in medium to high-speed corners.

===============================================================================
Engine and Powertrain:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Power Unit Mode: Utilizing Qualifying mode (Mode 6) to maximize power output during practice simulations and qualifying runs.
- ERS Deployment: Strategy focused on optimizing deployment for medium-speed corners (Turns 4, 7, and 10) to enhance acceleration and maintain consistent lap times.

===============================================================================
Tyre Management:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Tyre Compound: Soft (2016 Pirelli)
- Tyre /0CTF{M4xVerStoppen}/
- Tyre Pressures: Front 22.0 psi, Rear 20.5 psi
- Tyre Wear and Temperature Monitoring: Regular intervals to assess performance degradation and adjust setup parameters accordingly for optimal grip and longevity.

===============================================================================
Driver Feedback:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Verstappen reported initial setup providing a balanced platform with slight understeer noted in medium-speed corners (Turns 5, 9, and 12). Suggested rear wing adjustment to improve corner entry stability and overall grip levels.

===============================================================================
Session Strategy:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Planned adjustments include fine-tuning aerodynamic settings based on initial telemetry data to optimize performance for qualifying simulations in FP2.
- Emphasis on data collection regarding tyre wear and degradation to formulate optimal race strategy considering Barcelona's demanding track conditions.

===============================================================================
Notes 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Weather conditions: Clear skies, ambient temperature 22°C, track temperature 30°C. Optimal conditions for setup evaluation and performance testing.
- Team remains confident in initial setup direction but anticipates iterative adjustments throughout the weekend based on evolving track conditions and performance feedback.
